# Title

> The title needs to match the title listed on the Summit registration site for your lab.

## Table of Contents

> Break your lab up into lessons. Include each lesson in the table of contents. Table of contents should only list Heading 1s

* [Lab Overview](#lab-overview)
* [Lesson 1 - Brief Description](#lesson-1---brief-description)
* [Lesson 2 - Brief description](#lesson-2---brief-description)
* [Next Steps](#next-steps)
* [Appendix](#appendix)

# Lab Overview

The lab overview should give the attendee a general idea of what this lab is focused on and how they might use the information within to gain additional value from their Adobe solutions. This section should include:

## Key Takeaways

* List the key takeaways lab attendees should leave with
* A second key takeaway
* A third key takeaway??!

## Prerequisites

* List the required Adobe Solutions
* List any provisioning requirements that need to be completed prior to beginning this lab
* List any third party software or environments that may be needed to complete this lab

# Lesson 1 - Brief Description

## Objective

1. Objective should clearly state the goal of the lesson.
2. The second learning objective.
3. A third objective?!

## Lesson Context

Each lesson should have explanatory paragraphs that give the reader the information they need about that lesson. You can think of these paragraphs as you talk track that you would use during the presentation. The goal is to give the reader the information they need to understand and complete the lab with or without your physical presence.

### Exercise 1 

 Each exercise should accomplish a major milestone rather than a simple click. You can use screenshots, numbered lists, click paths, and supporting paragraphs to guide the reader through your exercise.

 1. Login to your lab machine with the following credentials
    * Username: <Lab number>
    * Password: *summit2019*
 2. Include figures to make instructions more clear. Make sure to include an italicized caption.

3. You can also include small code snippets with syntax highlighting. Try to use syntax highlighting whenever possible.

    ```js
    // Here is a short code snippet
    console.log("Hello World!");
    ```
4. For larger code blocks it is preferrable to store the entire file in the supporting *resources* folder and simply link to it:

    Copy [sample.js](resources/sample.js) in to your project's directory

5. Make sure all code is well-commented and explained

### Exercise 2

Notes should be used throughout your lab manual to point out tips, tricks, and gotchas to the user. You might include alternative methods, future reference guidance, off topic, or outside lab scope scenarios in notes.

> Pro Tip! You can use the `>` in your MD file to create a quote block. 

Tables are also quite useful:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

# Lesson 2 - Brief Description

## Objective

## Lesson Context

### Exercise 2.1

### Exercise 2.2

### Exercise 2.3

# Next Steps

At the end of your lab manual it is reccommended to include a **Next Steps** section for lab attendees to continue learning.

## Additional Resources

# Appendix

An appendix section is also a nice to have and include reference links to documentation.
