### Lesson Context

> TODO 

1. Two approaches
    1. external Node server serves the app and consumes content from AEM headless
    2. AEM instance and an OSGi service in the middle POSTs the model to the Node Instance and injects it into the HTML of the AEM Page
2. ideally spin local Node instance and connect AEM simulate SSR

#### Exercise 8.1
