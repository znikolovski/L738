## Lab Overview

The lab overview should give the attendee a general idea of what this lab is focused on and how they might use the information within to gain additional value from their Adobe solutions. This section should include:

### Key Takeaways

* List the key takeaways lab attendees should leave with
* A second key takeaway
* A third key takeaway??!

### Prerequisites

* List the required Adobe Solutions
* List any provisioning requirements that need to be completed prior to beginning this lab
* List any third party software or environments that may be needed to complete this lab

### Lab Machine Environment

* AEM author instance
* Maven - version?
* NPM - version?
* Node - version?
* Angular CLI - version?
* Visual Studio Code
* Eclipse with AEM dev tools
* Mac OS

## Lesson 1 - SPA Starter Kit 

> Danny

### Objective

1. Objective should clearly state the goal of the lesson.
2. The second learning objective.
3. A third objective?!

### Lesson Context

> TODO

## Lesson 2 - Hello World

> Danny

### Objective

1. TODO

### Lesson Context

> TODO

#### Exercise 2.1

## Lesson 3 - WKND Events App

> Danny

### Objective

1. TODO

### Lesson Context

> TODO

#### Exercise 3.1

## Lesson 4 - JSON Contract

> Danny

### Objective

1. JSON Structure
2. Front-end and back-end agree
3. factor in Authoring
    * :type
4. SDK -> provides access to model to adapt to use cases -> MapTo

### Lesson Context

> TODO

#### Exercise 4.1

## Lesson 5 - Front-end Development

> Patrick

### Objective

1. Observe how frontend components map to AEM resources
2. Hear about how the data structure served by AEM is provided as component properties
3. Learn how to drive the content author experience
4. Better understand the role played by the ModelManager
5. Get an overview of the main components provided by the SDK

### Lesson Context

> The goal of the chapter is to experiment how editable frontend components are written. The chapter will go through topics such as 

* The consumption of AEM data
* The notion of library of components and dynamic instantiation
* How to pilot the authoring experience

#### Exercise 5.1

## Lesson 6 - Back-end Development

> Patrick

### Objective

1. What is the role played by the Sling Models?
3. What are the interfaces expected by the frontend libraries?

### Lesson Context

> TODO

#### Exercise 6.1

## Lesson 7 - Navigation and Routing

> Patrick

### Objective

1. See the relationship between the App routing and the ModelRouter
2. The multiple degrees of authorability: Dynamicity for portability and reusiablity

### Lesson Context

> TODO

#### Exercise 7.1

## Lesson 8 - Server Side Rendering

> Patrick

### Objective

1. What is Server Side Rendering?
2. Why use Server Side Rendering?
3. Understand the two candidate SSR architectures and their trade-off


### Lesson Context

> TODO 

1. Two approaches
    1. external Node server serves the app and consumes content from AEM headless
    2. AEM instance and an OSGi service in the middle POSTs the model to the Node Instance and injects it into the HTML of the AEM Page
2. ideally spin local Node instance and connect AEM simulate SSR

#### Exercise 8.1

## Next Steps

At the end of your lab manual it is recommended to include a **Next Steps** section for lab attendees to continue learning.

## Additional Resources

## Appendix

An appendix section is also a nice to have and include reference links to documentation.
